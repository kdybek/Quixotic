# Quixotic

This is a very basic Jisho.org to Anki flashcard generator. 
You need to have AnkiConnect installed, a deck called test created 
and a default note model named Basic for it to make any flashcards.
Only the most basic words are supported right now, but more cases 
will be added in the near future.
